True History of theÂ World

The Entity is pure power having both the ability to create and destroy life similar to other entities of the void. This entity was not god nor omnipotent it only operated on a scale larger than our own, it still needed to perform the same actions as any other lifeform, like rest and eat and "breath". It was "born" in the void therefore it is not constrained by the planets version of what it means to eat, sleep, or breath.

While passing the planet it settled itself in the sea and due to its immense size, its body moved the land up that was once under the waves, creating mountains and land.

An act of what appeared to be experimentation of its own abilities and purpose. similar to a child learning how to walk it took from itself seeds of its own being and planted it into the earth.

The seeds sprang forth life, while the entity observed, by observed it could feel the life it had a connection to all life that was being created. One curious observation that came from this creation was an attunement or focal point to a creature that had come from the life seeds. this creature was both connected to the planet as well as to the entity. Not only could the entity "hear" the creature's thoughts, but the creature was aware of the entity's presence and could almost "speak or hear" it as well.

While all of this happened in meer moments for the entity, for the life that sprang from the seeds, millinia had passed. The creatures developed skills of communicating through sound instead of "sight or connection" and eventually began to forget how to speak to the entity all together. Again, for the entity this was a momentary event and the Entity spent what was no more than a passing moment, recognizing there ability to understand it had come and gone and chose to finally rest as it felt that it had "observed" enough for now.

Overtime the planet began to grow over the Entity until it appeared to be a part of the planet itself. The creatures forgot all about the Entity that rested on the Planet but its "DNA" still lived in specific blood lines while in others it died out severing the connection forever.

Although, this bloodline, due to years of passing time, the knowledge of how to "use the void" was lost.

However, due to the creature's strong connection to the earth and its elements another skill was practiced (MAGIC).

Every planet in the know universe have what is akin to a soul. Within the planets soul lies a will. This will is the force that is driven by the planet to impose itself upon the universe. The planets can not think, they do not feel, they do not speak, they only act in a direction that is a force that has no known destination or purpose. The planet that the entity landed on happened to have a symbiotic approach to its force and gained strength by passing its energy on to other lifeforms. All lifeforms that were eventually imparted with its energy carry with it the same force that comes from the planet. Therefore the lifeforms from this planet were driven by a need to pass on their memories, wisdom, love, kindness, caring, interests, knowledge. This force can be expressed by each lifeform in various strange ways. Sometimes it would be to the benefit of those around it and other times it would cause death and destruction. their were other lifeforms driven by this force that saw other lifeforms expressing their energy for good and for harm and chose to hide away from other lifeforms to no longer play the dance that was imposed on them by the planets energy. This energy that drove the lifeforms into an unknown future.
